## Introduction

In this **module,** we'll be learning about a few fundamental concepts such as Rigidbody and **Colliders, which will assist us in moving our characters**. We'll also learn how to add animations to our character. It is suggested that you do **the** exercises for this module in a separate Unity project, although you can continue using your game project from lesson 5.4 onwards.
